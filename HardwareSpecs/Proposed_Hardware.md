# Hardware proposals.
The objectives is to purchase hardware and licenses to meet the following criteria:
- to create a full technology stack to run virtualized environment (firewall, connectvity, compute, storage)
- on a budget of $2500 to $5000
- physical footprint less than 4x4x4 (smaller is better)
- in addition to internal connectivity, support 4-6 ethernet devices + wireless

Proposed hardware configurations should include links to pricing and specific model numbers/specs. Extra details are nice to have. Each proposal should be broken into groups, such that a threshold of cash gets us a minimal viable product, and additional cash goes toward expanding compute and storage capacity.  For example:

## Demo Proposal (unlicensed) - $4200
### Group 1 - $1800
- Some Converged Compute platform - $1200
  - Storage
  - RAM
- some Firewall (with 16 ports + Wireless, support for 1y) - $600
### Group 2 - $1200
- Some Converged Compute platform - $1200
  - Storage
  - RAM
### Group 3 - $1200
- Some Converged Compute platform - $1200
  - Storage
  - RAM
