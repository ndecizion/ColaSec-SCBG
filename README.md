# ColaSec-SCBG
The new home of SCBG, ColaSec's cyber-range/hacking lab/instructional environment.

## What's going on
We're changing directions with SCBG and splitting the mission into two different efforts. Read more [here](ColaSec_IV:The_Search_For_Hardware.md).

If you want to help in specing out the new hardware we'll be purchasing, head on over to [our proposed hardware colaboration page.](/HardwareSpecs/Proposed_Hardware.md)

The legacy data can be found at https://github.com/ndecizion/ColaSecCyberRange
