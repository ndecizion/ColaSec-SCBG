# It's Been a Long Road 
We're starting on a new direction for SCBG in 2021. After years of false starts, struggles with hardware, moves, restarts, and difficulty finding a home, to say nothing of a pandemic, we've come to the conclusion that it's time to change directions. SCBG has always had two primary objectives:
1. Give people who've never done it hands on experience with a real rack, and and enterprise grade equipiment. 
2. Create a virtual corporate network and attack hosts to practice defending and breaking into our networks.

Then we decided we wanted to do more:

3. Run CTF events
4. Hold instrucitonal classes on platforms like JuiceShop

There's a couple of problems with all this.  
First, objective 1 really jumps up and down on objectives 2-X, because having newbies come in and disassemble your equipment then reassemble it is, generally speaking, bad for up time. Engineers who build networks professionally do not, as a rule, disassemble them and reassemble them for funsies.  

Second, in order to meet objective 1, the equipment needs to be somewhere easy to get to and publically accessible. The rack that we have is a full 8 foot cabinet, and the equpiment it houses is old. Old hardware means that it consumes more power for less performance, and being enterprise grade server equipment, that means that it's VERY loud. Being big, power hungry, and loud makes it an unattractive house guest, so we've struggled to find a home for the equipment.

# A New Hope
This project started without funding and operated strictly on donated equipment, because we don't collect dues, and the organizers budget is not infinite. But now that we've organized as a 501c3 and established an avenue for corporate donations, the possibility of using off the shelf hardware is within reach.

Our new direction for 2021 is to select hardware for purchase, put it together with a formal proposal, then solicit donations of cash, hardware, or licenses. This hardware will be split into tiers such that our first $2000 - $3000 will buy a working lab, and any additional money will expand our compute & storage hardware. We intend to purchase enterprise licenses for a hypervisor, a real firewall, and stop dinking around with FOSS solutions.

Expanding on this plan, we intend have as much of this scripted as possible, such that we can store the entire configuration for the environment right here in this github repository. This will be a learning curve for all of us, but in the DevOpsy future we're all heading toward, infrastructure, servers, and networking as code will give our members valuable experience.

In the spirit of getting people used to working with GitHub, we'll [collaborate on specing the hardware here](/HardwareSpecs/Proposed_Hardware.md).

# The Bucket and The Beast
But what of our existing hardware?  It's not bound for the scrap heap quite yet.

Our intent is for it to live on as a training environment, and as soon as it's safe to congregate indoors we will have evening or weekend sessions to give folks guided hands on time. Our hope is to partner with an educational instituion willing to provide us space to store it, and provide realitively free access to the hardware. We'll keep you informed at our regular meetings.
